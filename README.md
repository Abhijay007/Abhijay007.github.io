# Jekyll website

Uptane's project website is created with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and extends
the [GitHub pages slate theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/slate).

The site is available [here](https://uptane.github.io/).

## Maintenance and re-use

# Contributing to Uptane

If you would like to contribute content, read the following documentation for helpful information and guidelines.

We appreciate and recognize all contributors.

# Fork the Repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page. This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

# Make Necessary Changes

To make changes, clone the forked repository to your machine.

## Clone the repository

Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click **Code**, and then **copy to clipboard**.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```bash
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project).

## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer:

```bash
cd uptane.github.io
```

Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:

```bash
git checkout -b <name-your-new-branch-name-after-your-issue>
```

For example:

```bash
git checkout -b issue-329
```

## Make necessary changes

Now, you can suggest contributions, make necessary changes to existing files, or add new files.

# Test in local and push changes to GitHub

Before you push changes to GitHub, build this GitHub pages site locally to preview and test the changes.

## Prerequisites

This GitHub Pages site is built with Jekyll. Before you can use Jekyll to test a site, you must [install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

## Test your changes locally

Change to the repository directory on your computer and execute the following command to run the Jekyll site locally.

1. To install and update all dependencies.

   ```bash
   gem install "jekyll-mentions"     
   ```

   **Note**: Run the above command one time before using the tools each day.

2. Start the local web server, do not build the site first

   ```bash
   jekyll serve
   ```

   To preview the site in your web browser navigate to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).


## Commit changes

After you have a successful testing in local with your changes, you are ready to commit those changes.

If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see your changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```bash
git add <file>
```

All commits should be signed off (`-s` flag on `git commit`). To use the `-s` option, make sure you configure your git name (user.name) and email address (user.email).

Now commit those changes using the git commit command:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Add README.md"
```

## Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```bash
git push origin <add-your-branch-name>
```

replacing `<add-your-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

### Basic commands

GitHub pages are served directly from the repository. No pre-building necessary.
For development deployment, we recommend the following commands (requires
`jekyll` to be installed and available on your path):

```shell
# Automatic verbose re-build whenever sources change
jekyll build --watch --verbose

# Development server available on http://127.0.0.1:4000
jekyll serve
```

#### Changing the header
Set the variables `title`, `description` and `logo_url`  in
[`_config.yml`](_config.yml) to customize the header. These variables are used
in [`_layouts/default.html`](_layouts/default.html) to populate the header.

#### Changing the menu
The menu is populated from the YAML file in
[`_data/navbar.yml`](_data/navbar.yml). It should be enough to just customize
this file. The menu has two levels. On the first level you can specify a `text`
and either a `url` or a `sub` (not both). If `url` is specified the menu item
will link to that url. If `sub` items are specified, hovering over a menu item
will open a dropdown menu, showing the sub items.
Sub items also have a `text` and a `url` that can be used analogously.
Additionally, subitems have a boolean `external` variable that, if set to
`true`, adds a little external link icon next to the link text.

The menu is styled in [`_sass/navbar.scss`](_sass/navbar.scss) and its markup
can be found in [`_includes/navbar.html`](_includes/navbar.html), which is
included in the default layout.

#### Changing the footer
Just customize [`_includes/footer.html`](_includes/footer.html).

#### General styles and layouts
Base styles are inherited from
[`_sass/jekyll-theme-slate.scss`](_sass/jekyll-theme-slate.scss) and
[`_sass/rouge-github.scss`](_sass/rouge-github.scss). You should not modify
those styles, but rather override them in your own `_sass/*.scss` or
in [`_sass/main.scss`](_sass/main.scss), where currently all custom styles
are defined. All styles are included in
[`assets/css/style.scss`](assets/css/style.scss), which gets compiled to css on
`jekyll build`. The resulting `assets/css/style.css` is included in the default
layout.


### Customizing and adding content
Adding content is as simple as creating `*.html`, or `*.md` files and filling
them with content.
Additionally, you should specify at least two properties in each file's [YAML
front matter section](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/), to tell jekyll
that you want to embed your content in the default layout and to give the
container in which your content will be placed a unique CSS id. This is what
front matter looks like:
```yaml
---
layout: default
css_id: my-funky-page
---
```

When running `jekyll build` each file in the project directory gets processed,
e.g. embedded in the the specified layout, and, in the case of markdown,
converted to `HTML`. The result is copied to the build directory, i.e. `_site`,
preserving relative paths, but changing the file extension to `.html`.
You can read more about [creating pages in the jekyll
docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/).

### Adding assets
Add assets, e.g. images or JavaScript, to [`assets`](assets).

#### Replace favicon.ico
[`favicon.ico`](favicon.ico) should be served from the root of the project.
Just replace the current one with the `favicon.ico` of your project.
