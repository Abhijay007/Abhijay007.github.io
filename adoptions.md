### Adoptions
-------------

Given the proprietary nature of the automotive industry, public acknowledgement
of technology adoptions is not commonly done. However, Uptane is already
impacting the way car manufacturers protect motorists from remote attacks as  
a number of original equipment manufacturers aadopt the framework, either
directly or through the efforts of third-party suppliers.  Publicly acknowledged
adopters include Advanced Telematic Systems (now HERE Technologies), Airbiquity,
and Automotive Grade Linux.
