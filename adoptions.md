# Adoptions
-------------

Uptane has been adopted by several major automakers, which will lead to
its adoption across millions of vehicles.  While the automotive industry
is legendarily secretive, we can speak about adoption from a few different
parties.

First, Uptane is incorporated in 
[Automotive Grade Linux](https://www.automotivelinux.org/), which is 
supported by 
[major OEMs and suppliers](https://www.automotivelinux.org/about/members).
This is via ATS's [aktualizr](https://github.com/advancedtelematic/aktualizr)
implementation, which was also adopted in [GENIVI](https://www.genivi.org/).


Interested parties that wish to purchase Uptane compatible components can
speak with many suppliers including:

* Advanced Telematic Systems (ATS), now 
[HERE Technologies](https://www.here.com/en), integrated Uptane 
into two of its OTA solutions, [OTA Plus](https://www.here.com/en/products-services/here-automotive-suite/ota-software-management/here-ota-connect) 
and [ATS Garage](https://github.com/advancedtelematic/ats-garage-docs). ATS 
was the first European third-party supplier to publicly 
adopt the framework.

* [Airbiquity](https://www.airbiquity.com) incorporated Uptane into its 
[OTAmatic](https://www.airbiquity.com/product-offerings/software-and-data-management) 
over-the-air software and data management solution. The product was honored in 
2017 with a 
[BIG (Business Intelligence Group) Award for Business in the 2017 New Product of the Year Award category]((https://www.airbiquity.com/news/press-releases/airbiquity-otamatic-named-2017-new-product-year-business-intelligence-group)).
