### Adoptions
-------------

Uptane is already impacting the way car manufacturers protect motorists from
remote attacks, as a number of original equipment manufacturers have adopted the framework. A number of these adoptions have come through the efforts of third-party suppliers.

* Advanced Telematic Systems (ATS), now HERE Technologies,
integrated Uptane into two of its OTA solutions, OTA Plus and ATS Garage. ATS
was, to our knowledge, the first European third-party supplier to adopt the
framework.

* ATS also developed a C++ implementation of Uptane called aktualizr,
which has been integrated into Automotive Grade Linux (AGL). A collaborative
open source project. AGL brings together automakers, suppliers and technology
companies to advance the development and adoption of a fully open software
stack for the connected car. AGL is now currently used on vehicles manufactured
by Honda and Toyota.

* Airbiquity incorporated Uptane into its OTAmatic over-the-air software
and data management solution. The product was honored in 2017 with a
BIG (Business Intelligence Group) Award for Business in the 2017 New
Product of the Year Award category.
