# Adoptions
-------------

Uptane has been adopted by several major automakers, which will lead to
its adoption across millions of vehicles.  While the automotive industry
is legendarily secretive, we can speak about adoption from a few different
parties.

First, Uptane is incorporated in 
[Automotive Grade Linux](https://www.automotivelinux.org/), which is 
supported by 
[major OEMs and suppliers](https://www.automotivelinux.org/about/members).
This is via ATS's [aktualizr](https://github.com/advancedtelematic/aktualizr)
implementation, which was also adopted in [GENIVI](https://www.genivi.org/).


Interested parties that wish to purchase Uptane compatible components can
speak with many suppliers including:

* Advanced Telematic Systems (ATS), now HERE Technologies, integrated Uptane 
into two of its OTA solutions, OTA Plus and ATS Garage. ATS was the first 
European third-party supplier to publicly acknowledge adopting the framework.

* ATS also developed a C++ implementation of Uptane called aktualizr
that has been integrated into Automotive Grade Linux (AGL), a collaborative
open source project. AGL brings together automakers, suppliers, and technology
companies to advance the development and adoption of a fully open software stack for the connected car. AGL is now currently used on vehicles manufactured by Honda and Toyota.

* Airbiquity incorporated Uptane into its OTAmatic over-the-air software and data management solution. The product was honored in 2017 with a BIG (Business Intelligence Group) Award for Business in the 2017 New Product of the Year Award category.

* OTAinfo (need info)
