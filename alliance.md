# The Uptane Alliance

The Uptane Alliance was formally established in July of 2018 for the express
purpose of standardizing an open and secure design for over-the-air updates
for automobiles.  In practice, this process has involved improving and
standardizing the Uptane open-source software. Formed under the umbrella of
IEEE's [International Standards and Technology Organization](https://ieee-isto.org/) and now 
a [Linux Foundation Joint Development Foundation](http://www.jointdevelopment.org/) alliance, the
Alliance is a nonprofit consortium of companies, non-profit groups, and government agencies.
In addition to developing, disseminating and supporting the implementation of
standards to improve the security of software updates for the automotive industry,
the Alliance will support the continuing development and adoption of Uptane technology.

Individuals who wish to contribute to the standardization initiative can do
so, regardless of whether or not their organization joins the Uptane Alliance.
Contact [Lois Anne DeLong](mailto:lad278@nyu.edu) to be put on the mailing list for
the Uptane Standards committee. This will keep you apprised of how the work is
progressing and give you the opportunity to contribute to the process.
