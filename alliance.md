The Uptane Alliance was formally established in July of 2018 for the express
purpose of standardizing the Uptane open-source software. Formed under the umbrella of 
IEEE's [International Standards and Technology Organization](https://ieee-isto.org/) the 
Alliance is a nonprofit consortium of companies, non-profit groups, and government agencies.
In addition to developing, disseminating and supporting the implementation of 
standards to improve the security of software updates for the automotive industry,
the Alliance will support the continuing development and adoption of Uptane technology by
providing access to resources of IEEE, including publications, meetings and conferences,
abd administrative support.

Interested organizations can become part of the Uptane Alliance by completing an
application and returning it to: 

Uptane Alliance

Piscataway, NJ  08854 USA

Note that it is important to send the  c/o IEE-ISTO as IEEE has another standards
organization. Also, individuals can participate in the standardization initiative
whether or not their organization joins the Alliance. Contact
Lois Anne Deing at lad278@nyu.edu to be put on the mailing list.

The IEEE Industry Standards and Technology Organization (ISTO) was established in
January 1999 as a global, not-for-profit corporation 
[501(c)(6)] designed to accelerate and extend standards development
and adoption activities for technology industry consortia.
