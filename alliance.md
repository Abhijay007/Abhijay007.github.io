The Uptane Alliance was formally established in July of 2018 for the express
purpose of standardizing the Uptane open-source software. Formed under the umbrella of
IEEE's [International Standards and Technology Organization](https://ieee-isto.org/) the
Alliance is a nonprofit consortium of companies, non-profit groups, and government agencies.
In addition to developing, disseminating and supporting the implementation of
standards to improve the security of software updates for the automotive industry,
the Alliance will support the continuing development and adoption of Uptane technology by
providing access to resources of IEEE, including publications, meetings and conferences,
and administrative support.

Interested organizations can become part of the Uptane Alliance by [completing a
membership application](/papers/UA_member_agreement_71618.pdf) and returning it to:

Note that it is important to include "IEEE-ISTO" in the mailing address as
IEEE supports another standards organization at the same address.

You can learn more about the organization and governing structure of the Uptane Alliance
by reviewing the [bylaws](/papers_UA_bylaws_71618).

individuals who wish to contribute to the standardization initiative can do so,
regardless of whether or not their organization joins the Alliance. Contact
Lois Anne DeLong at lad278@nyu.edu to be put on the mailing list for the Uptane
Standards committee. This will keep you apprised of how the work is progressing
and give you the opportunity to contribute to the process.

The IEEE Industry Standards and Technology Organization (ISTO) was established in
January 1999 as a global, not-for-profit corporation
[501(c)(6)] designed to accelerate and extend standards development
and adoption activities for technology industry consortia.
