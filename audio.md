The basic principles of Uptane, and the framework's development over time, are addressed in some detail in a series of Powerpoint presentations originally put together for Uptane's industry workshops. Links to these slides appear below, including those from the most recent Uptane Industry workshop, held virtually in May 2020. This includes a new overview presentation that reviews the most salient points of Uptane's design and guidelines for its implementation and deployment.

This section also includes links to a demo video explaining how Uptane works, and to a video of Trishank Kuppusamy delivering the first academic talk on Uptane at escar 16.
