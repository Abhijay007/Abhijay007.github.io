#### Security Audits

Both Uptane and TUF, the secure framework on which it was based, have undergone
a number of security audits. Given the proprietary nature of the automotive
industry, links to these reports are not publicly available.

* **Cure53:** An audit, conducted in 2016/2017 of an Advanced Telematic
Systems/HERE Inc. implementation of Uptane. No security issues were found related
to the design.

* **NCC Group:** An assessment, conducted in late 2017, of Kolide's TUF
implementation. The study found 0 critical risk issues, 0 high risk issues,
0 medium risk issues, 1 low risk issue, and 1 informational issue. The two
issues identified were minor, relating to the particular implementation's
default configuration and the way it stored backups.


* **SWRI** Performed in 2018, this review by the Southwest Research Institute
did find a bug in the Reference Implementation that has since been addressed, but
found no design issues.
