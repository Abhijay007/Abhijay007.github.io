Uptane is the first software update system designed to protect the computerized
units of automobiles from the increasingly viable risk of remote exploitation,
particularly through "over-the-air" software updates.
The framework is integrated into [Automotive Grade Linux](https://www.automotivelinux.org/),
an open source system currently used on vehicles
manufactured by Honda and [Toyota](https://www.automotivelinux.org/announcements/2017/05/30/automotive-grade-linux-platform-debuts-on-the-2018-toyota-camry), and a number of other original equipment manufacturers have also begun
adopting the system. In July 2018, the Uptane Alliance was formed under the
umbrella of the [IEEE/ISTO Federation](https://ieee-isto.org/isto-blog/). As a
nonprofit ISTO organization, Uptane will be standardizing secure methods for
the implementation and maintenance of update systems, and the deployment of
secure fixes for any vulnerabilities exploited in an attack.
