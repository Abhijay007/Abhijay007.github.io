Uptane is the first software update system designed to protect the computerized
units of automobiles from the increasingly viable risk of remote exploitation.
The framework is helping to secure OTA software updates for vehicles
manufactured by one of the three major U.S. automakers. It is integrated into [Automotive Grade Linux](https://www.automotivelinux.org/),
an open source operating system and framework that currently used on vehicles
from Honda and [Toyota](https://www.automotivelinux.org/announcements/2017/05/30/automotive-grade-linux-platform-debuts-on-the-2018-toyota-camry). In July 2018, the project became an [IEEE/ISTO Federation
Member,}(https://ieee-isto.org/isto-blog/) under which it will issue standards
to ensure safe and efficient practices for
the implementation and maintenance of update systems, and the deployment of
secure fixes for any vulnerabilities exploited in an attack.
