Uptane is the first software update system designed to protect over-the-air
software for the computerized units of automobiles from actors that can 
even compromise servers and networks at the automaker.  Hence, Uptane is 
designed to even be resilient to nation state attackers.
Uptane is integrated into 
[Automotive Grade Linux](https://www.automotivelinux.org/),
an open source system currently used by many large OEMs, and has been adopted
by other large OEMs, which will mean over 1/3 of new cars on US roads will 
include Uptane in the next few years.

In addition to being the secure, de facto standard for software updates, 
in July 2018, the [IEEE/ISTO Federation](https://ieee-isto.org/) began
formally standardizing Uptane under a non-profit, the Uptane Alliance.
