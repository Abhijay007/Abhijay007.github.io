Uptane is the first compromise-resilient software update security system for the automotive industry.  
It protects the integrity of Electronic Control Units or ECUs against a variety of attack strategies, while
maintaining the necessary flexibility to accommodate differing deployment scenarios and update 
customization needs. Publicly acknowledged adopters include
[Airbiquityâ€™s OTAmatic](https://www.airbiquity.com/jp/news-press/press-releases/airbiquity-
introduces-otamatic-connected vehicle-over-air-ota-software-updates-and-data-management) 
program and the [OTA Plus and ATS Garage](https://advancedtelematic.com/en/press-releases/ats-is-
integrating-the-uptane-security-framework-for-over-the-air-software-updates-to-connected-vehicles.html )
programs from Advanced Telematic Systems (ATS). Another ATS program, a  C++ implementation of Uptane called [aktualizr](https://github.com/advancedtelematic/aktualizr ), also has been integrated into [Automotive Grade Linux](https://www.automotivelinux.org/ ), an open source operating system and framework created under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation.

TUF is hosted by the [**Linux Foundation**](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) as
part of the [**Cloud Native Computing Foundation**](https://www.cncf.io/) (CNCF) 
and is used [in production](/adopters.html) by companies such as Docker, 
DigitalOcean, Flynn, LEAP, Kolide, Cloudflare, and VMware.  A variant of TUF called 
[**Uptane**](https://uptane.github.io/) is widely used to secure over-the-air 
updates in automobiles.
