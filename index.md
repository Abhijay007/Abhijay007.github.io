Uptane is an open and secure software update system design which
protects software delivered over-the-air to the computerized units of
automobiles.  The framework can thwart attacks from malicious actors who can
compromise servers and networks used to sign and deliver updates.  Hence, it is designed to be resilient even to the best efforts of nation state
attackers. There are multiple different free open source and closed source
implementations available.  Uptane is integrated into [Automotive Grade Linux](https://www.automotivelinux.org/),
an open source system currently used by many large OEMs, and has also been adopted by a number of U.S. and international manufacturers. Within the next few years, about one-third of new cars on U.S. roads will include Uptane.

Currently considered the *de facto* secure standard for software updates on
automobiles, in July 2018, formal standardization of Uptane began under a non-profit consortium called the [Uptane
Alliance](https://ieee-isto.org/member_programs/uptane-alliance/). [Uptane Standard for Design and Implementation](https://github.com/uptane/uptane-standard/releases/download/1.0.0/ieee-isto-6100.1.0.0.uptane-standard.html) version 1.0, which presents procedures for secure design and implementation of the framework, was released on July 31, 2019, under the auspices of the [IEEE/ISTO Federation](https://ieee-isto.org/). The initiative now
continues as a Linux Foundation Joint Development Foundation project, and [version 1.1.0](/papers/uptane-standard.1.1.0.html) was released on January 8, 2021. Recommended deployment strategies are under active development, and are published and regularly updated [on this site](/deployment-considerations/index.html). All Uptane materials, including [technical papers](https://uptane.github.io/publications.html),
[security audits](https://uptane.github.io/audits.html), and
[a public reference implementation](https://github.com/uptane/uptane)
are also freely available for all to use without a fee.
