## Project Overview ##

Uptane is the first software update security system for the automotive 
industry that is designed to resist nation-state level actors.  Uptane 
is designed so that the security of software updates will degrade gracefully
as attackers gain different levels of access to vehicles and to the 
automaker's infrastructure itself.  As such, even an attacker that compromises
servers, bribes operators in an automotive company, gains access to vehicular
networks, etc. is prevented from causing [many types of harm to the 
vehicle](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pBK--40BCg_ofww4GES0weYFB6tZRedAjUy6PJ4Rgzk/edit#heading=h.ertrftdz3oms).


Even in situations with adversarial interference, Uptane provides a method
to authenticate software updates
before they are installed on the connected units that control
vital components, such as brakes and door locks. In doing so, Uptane provides
a solution to a growing threat vector targeting cars and trucksâ€”malware
disguised as software updates. 

The Uptane framework is flexible and can be incorporated into existing 
update strategies that OEMs use.  Thus, anything from end users updating
using flash drives, to over-the-air updates, to 
[automated operations](https://sbabic.github.io/swupdate/overview.html)
using package managers can benefit from Uptane's security with very low 
operational overhead. 


Uptane was developed through as open source software under under a grant from 
the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and is completely free for anyone
to use.  Uptane 
was created by a team of researchers from the New York University Tandon School
of Engineering in Brooklyn, NY, the University of Michigan Transportation
Research Institute in Ann Arbor, MI, and the Southwest Research Institute in
Austin, TX. The three partner
institutions worked in close collaboration with vehicle manufacturers and
suppliers that are collectively responsible for [78% of the vehicles on U.S. roads.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8278174&tag=1 )

Uptane was recognized by **Popular Science** magazine as one of the
[top security inventions of 2017,](https://www.popsci.com/top-security-innovations-2017 )
and the OTAmatic program from Airbiquity, in which Uptane is a key security component,
was awarded a [BIG Award for Business](https://www.bintelligence.com/big-awards-for-business/) in
the 2017 New Product Category. In 2018, NYU Tandon School of
Engineering became an [associate member](https://www.automotivelinux.org/announcements/2018/08/16/automotive-grade-linux-extends-global-reach-with-six-new-members) of the [Linux Foundation,](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/)
and a member of the [Automotive Grade Linux](https://www.automotivelinux.org/) project,
in part due to the Foundation's adoption of Uptane technology.

On July 2018, the Uptane Alliance a non-profit under IEEE/ISTO was formed to 
lead the future direction of Uptane research, development, and deployment. 
The primary task of the Alliance is to be a neutral arbiter that oversees the 
formal standardization of Uptane and promotes security of software updates for 
the automotive industry.
