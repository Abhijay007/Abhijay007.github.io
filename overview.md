## Overview ##


Uptane authenticates updated files and images sent to ECUs before they are downloaded. By doing so,
it addresses a growing threat vector against automobiles— malware introduced to ECUs via software updates. 
It automatically verifies the authenticity of software updates to cars  by checking metadata that 
lists lengths, hash function, and timestamps. The file is downloaded only if the metadata matches the
last known verified image of the repository. 

Uptane can be incorporated into a number of update strategies—which can range from manual operations
using flash drives, to [automated operations](https://sbabic.github.io/swupdate/overview.html)
using package managers. It offers particular support for the growing trend of using  “over-the-air”
or SOTA programming. 

Developed under a grant from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Uptane was 
guided by a team of researchers from the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute in 
Ann Arbor, MI, New York University Tandon School of Engineering, in Brooklyn, NY, 
and the Southwest Research Institute in Austin, TX. The three partner
institutions, worked in close collaboration with vehicle manufacturers and
suppliers responsible for [78% of the vehicles on U.S. roads.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8278174&tag=1 )

The framework  was recognized by Popular Science magazine as one of the
[top 100 inventions of 2017,](https://www.popsci.com/top-security-innovations-2017 ) and 
the OTAmatic program from Airbiquity, in which Uptane is a key component of the security package, 
was awarded a [BIG Award for Business](https://www.bintelligence.com/big-awards-for-business/)in the 2017 New
Product Category.
