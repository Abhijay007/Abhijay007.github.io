## Overview ##

Uptane is the first software update security system designed for
the specific demands of the automotive industry. It provides a method
to authenticate software updates
on cars before they are downloaded to the connected units that control
vital components, such as brakes and door locks. In doing so, Uptane provides
a solution to a growing threat vector targeting cars and trucks—malware
disguised as software updates. The framework provides this protection by
checking accompanying metadata listing lengths,
hash function, and timestamps. An updated file is downloaded only if the
metadata matches the last known verified image of the repository.

The framework can be incorporated into a number of existing update
strategies—which can range from manual operations
using flash drives, to [automated operations](https://sbabic.github.io/swupdate/overview.html)
using package managers. It offers particular support for systems that rely
on “over-the-air,” or SOTA programming. SOTA is a much more efficient delivery
mechanism for updates, but can create [new openings](https://theconversation.com/auto-industry-must-tackle-its-software-problems-to-stop-hacks-as-cars-go-online-45325) for would-be attackers.

Developed under a grant from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Uptane was
guided by a team of researchers from the New York University Tandon School of
Engineering, in Brooklyn, NY, the University of Michigan Transportation
Research Institute in Ann Arbor, MI, and the Southwest Research Institute in
Austin, TX. The three partner
institutions, worked in close collaboration with vehicle manufacturers and
suppliers which are collectively responsible for [78% of the vehicles on U.S. roads.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8278174&tag=1 )

The framework was recognized by **Popular Science** magazine as one of the
[top 100 inventions of 2017,](https://www.popsci.com/top-security-innovations-2017 )
and the OTAmatic program from Airbiquity, in which Uptane is a key security component,
was awarded a [BIG Award for Business](https://www.bintelligence.com/big-awards-for-business/)in
the 2017 New Product Category. In 2018, NYU Tandon School of
Engineering became an [associate member](https://www.automotivelinux.org/announcements/2018/08/16/automotive-grade-linux-extends-global-reach-with-six-new-members) of the [Linux Foundation,](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/)
and a Bronze member of the [Automotive Grade Linux](https://www.automotivelinux.org/) project,
in part due to the Foundation's adoption of Uptane technology.

On July 2018, the Uptane Alliance, a
consortium of companies, nonprofit and
academic organizations, and government agencies, was formed to lead the
future direction of Uptane research, development, and deployment. The primary task
of the Alliance is to oversee the standardization of Uptane software to better secure
software updates for the automotive industry.
