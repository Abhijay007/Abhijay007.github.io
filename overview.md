## Overview ##


Uptane provides a method to authenticate software updates on automobiles before
they are downloaded to the connected units that control vital components, such
as brakes and door locks. In doing so, it provides a solution to a growing threat vector
targeting cars and trucks—malware that is introduced to connected electronic control
units (ECUs) through software updates.
Uptane provides this protection by checking metadata that lists lengths,
hash function, and timestamps.An updated file is downloaded only if the
metadata matches the last known verified image of the repository.

This software framework can be incorporated into a number of exisitng update
strategies—which can range from manual operations
using flash drives, to [automated operations](https://sbabic.github.io/swupdate/overview.html)
using package managers. It offers particular support for the growing trend of
using  “over-the-air” or SOTA programming, which provide more efficient delivery
of updates, but can create new openings for would-be attacker.

Developed under a grant from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Uptane was
guided by a team of researchers from the University of Michigan Transportation
Research Institute in Ann Arbor, MI, New York University Tandon School of
Engineering, in Brooklyn, NY,
and the Southwest Research Institute in Austin, TX. The three partner
institutions, worked in close collaboration with vehicle manufacturers and
suppliers which are collectively responsible for [78% of the vehicles on U.S. roads.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8278174&tag=1 )

The framework was recognized by Popular Science magazine as one of the
[top 100 inventions of 2017,](https://www.popsci.com/top-security-innovations-2017 )
and the OTAmatic program from Airbiquity, in which Uptane is a key component of
the security package, was awarded a [BIG Award for Business](https://www.bintelligence.com/big-awards-for-business/)in
the 2017 New Product Category. In 2018, NYU Tandon School of
Engineering becomes an associate member of the Linux Foundation, and a
Bronze member of Automotive Grade Linux, in part due to the Foundation's adoption
of Uptane technology.
