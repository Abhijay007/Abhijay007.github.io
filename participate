# Participate

We welcome questions, feedback, and suggestions on any aspect of this project.
Send them to the [group email](uptane@googlegroups.com).

We are also interested in hearing about security problems in our Reference
Implementation. While cars are unlikely to use the reference code directly,
reporting any problems users identify in the code can help prevent their
duplications in production implementations. Please report such issues
using our GitHub [issue tracker](https://github.com/uptane/uptane/issues).

The Uptane project also welcomes the open source community, as well as representatives
from original equipment manufacturers, third-party suppliers, and government agencies
to contribute in a number of ways.

## Code Contributions
To make contributions to the code base of this project, either the reference
implementation, the demonstration code, or the documentation, submit a GitHub
pull request to this repository using
[these development instructions](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/lab-guidelines/blob/master/dev-workflow.md).
If submitting any new software feature or change, please include unit tests.

All submitted pull requests undergo review and automated testing, including, but
not limited to:
* Unit and build testing via Travis CI
* Review by one or more maintainers


## Code Issues, Bugs, Feature Requests

If you wish to report a bug or a security issue, or introduce a new feature to
either the reference implementation or demonstration code, please [open an issue]https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/lab-guidelines/issues/new)
on this.


## Security Audits

We welcome security audits of the Uptane design, or vulnerability reports of
the design or the code in this repository. Please contact lab director Justin Cappos or maintainer 
Sebastien Awwad listed on the "People" page. Uptane is defined in
[the three documents listed here](README.md#design-documentation).

Should the information be highly sensitive, auditors / reporters may employ
PGP encryption in an email to Justin Cappos using the public key whose PGP
fingerprint is also listed on the People page.

Audits of TUF alone (which Uptane employs) should instead be submitted
[per these
instructions](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/blob/develop/GOVERNANCE.md).
