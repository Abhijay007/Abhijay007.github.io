# Risks and Benefits of SOTA

Software updates are routinely performed  for a [number of reasons,](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-installing-software-updates-makes-us-wannacry/)
including the addition of new functionality, and upgrades to improve productivity. But, the  
primary reason for updating software is to address existing flaws in the code itself. Increasingly,
these updates are done using
[“software-over-the- air”](http://blog.ihs.com/remote-software-update%3A-future-growth-business)
or SOTA  strategies, in which revised versions of programs are sent directly to computing units
through broadcasts over the Internet. The strategy is  growing in popularity because it is a much
quicker and more cost-effective delivery mechanism than traditional methods, such as 
distributing flash drives or requiring customers to bring in their 
vehicles for servicing. Even established OEMs are recognizing the potential of this
strategy, with both [Ford and GM](https://www.consumerreports.org/automotive-technology/automakers-embrace-over-the-air-updates-can-we-trust-digital-car-repair/) 
recently announcing they would allow access to SOTA updates in some models by 2020. 

However, connecting ECUs to the Internet make them
[vulnerable](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/13/17007332/fiat-chrysler-uconnect-update-reboot-problem-broken) 
to a wide range of attacks, some of which introduce malware masquerading as legitimate updates. 
The potential consequences of such attacks could be costly indeed, not only in terms of recalls or
lost sales, but also potentially, in loss of life.
