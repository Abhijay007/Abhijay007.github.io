### Timeline

**2010**:  The Update Framework (TUF) is introduced in an academic research paper
coauthored by Justin Samuel and Justin Cappos.

**2011**: The TUF Project moves to New York University Polytechnic School of
Engineering (later NYU Tandon School of Engineering) when Justin Cappos
accepts a post as an assistant professor at the Brooklyn, NY, school.

**2013**: Cappos, along with Trishank Kuppusamy, and Vladimir Diaz begin research
into adapting TUF for Python, Ruby, and environments used
for cloud computing.  Kuppusamy, a Ph.D. student at the time, will later
become the lead developer on the Uptane project.

**2014**: Flynn becomes the first tech organization to adopt TUF when
it independently implements the program in its Go programming language. This
affirmed that the technology could be adapted to new applications.

**2015**: The U.S.Department of Homeland Security awards a grant of $1.2
million to the University of Michigan to fund a project called “Secure
Software Update Over-the-Air for Ground Vehicles Specification and Prototype.”

**2016**: A consortium including the University of Michigan Transportation Research
Institute (UMTRI), NYU Tandon (Cappos, Kuppusamy, Diaz, along with Sebastien Awwad),
and the Southwest Research Institute (SWRI), begin developing Uptane. The researchers
used the basic TUF design as a starting point for the framework. They also
launched a series of workshops at which OEMs (original equipment manufacturers,
ie. the auto companies), suppliers, and representatives of government agencies
would review and comment on the work in progress to insure alignment with
the intended market.

**2016**: *Uptane: Securing Software Updates for Automobiles* is presented at
escar 16.

**2017**: Uptane is officially introduced at press events in Ann Arbor, MI, and
Brooklyn, NY.

**2017**: Advanced Telematic Systems (ATS) becomes one of the first suppliers
to publicly acknowledge adoption of Uptane when it integrates the framework
into two of its OTA solutions, OTA Plus and ATS Garage.

**2017**: Uptane is named one of the year's most important innovations in
security by *Popular Science*.

**2018**: Airbiquity receives a BIG Award for Business in the 2017 New Product of
the Year Award category for its OTAmatic over-the-air software and data management
solution, which incorporates Uptane to secure its software updates.

**2018**: A C++ implementation of Uptane called aktualizr is integrated into
Automotive Grade Linux (AGL), a collaborative open source project in which
automakers, suppliers and technology companies work together to advance the
development and adoption of a fully open software stack for the connected car.

**2018** NYU Tandon School of Engineering becomes an associate member of the
Linux Foundation and a Bronze member of AGL on the strength of the Foundation’s
adoption of Uptane and TUF projects.
