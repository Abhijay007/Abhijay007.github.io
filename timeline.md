### Timeline

**2010**:  A predecessor technology of Uptane, The Update Framework (TUF), which
secures software updates on repositories, is introduced in an [academic research paper](papers/samuel_ccs_2010.pdf),
coauthored by Justin Samuel and Justin Cappos.

**2013**:  Cappos, along with Trishank Kuppusamy, and Vladimir Diaz begin research
into adapting TUF for Python, Ruby, and environments used
for cloud computing.  Kuppusamy, a Ph.D. student at the time, will later
use this experience in his work as a lead developer on the Uptane project.

**2015**: NYU Tandon receives a grant from the U.S.Department of Homeland Security
to begin work on a project to secure software updates on vehicles.

**2016**: A consortium of researchers at the [University of Michigan
Transportation Research Institute](http://www.umtri.umich.edu/) (UMTRI), NYU Tandon
(Cappos, Kuppusamy, Diaz, along with Sebastien Awwad), and the
[Southwest Research Institute](https://www.swri.org/) (SWRI),
begin developing Uptane, using the basic TUF design as a starting point. The research
team also begins a series of workshops at which OEMs (original equipment manufacturers,
ie. the auto companies), suppliers, and representatives of government agencies can
review and comment on the work in progress, and an online forum, where issues
could be raised. Both of these steps ensure alignment with
the intended market.

**2016**: [*Uptane: Securing Software Updates for Automobiles*](papers/kuppusamy_escar_16.pdf)
is presented at [escar 16](https://www.escar.info/escar-europe/history.html) by
lead author Kuppusamy. This
marked the first presentation of the project to an academic audience.

**2017**: Uptane is officially introduced at [press events](https://www.forbes.com/sites/leemathews/2017/01/19/uptane-will-protect-your-connected-car-from-hackers/#233b99d019be) in Ann Arbor, MI, and Brooklyn, NY.

**2017**: Advanced Telematic Systems (ATS), now [HERE Technologies](https://www.here.com/en),
becomes one of the first suppliers to publicly [acknowledge adoption](http://www.autoconnectedcar.com/2017/06/connected-car-news-marvell-telit-att-ats-continental-toyota-marvel-safe-drive-systems-cast-car2go-trimble/) of Uptane when it integrates the framework
into two of its OTA solutions, OTA Plus and ATS Garage.

**2017**: Uptane is named one of the year's most important innovations in
security by [*Popular Science*](https://www.popsci.com/top-security-innovations-2017).

**2018**: [Airbiquity](https://www.airbiquity.com) receives a
[BIG Award for Business](https://www.airbiquity.com/news/press-releases/airbiquity-otamatic-named-2017-new-product-year-business-intelligence-group) in the 2017 New Product of the Year Award category for its
OTAmatic over-the-air software and data management solution. The product
incorporates Uptane to secure its software updates.

**2018**: A C++ implementation of Uptane called [aktualizr](https://github.com/advancedtelematic/aktualizr)
is integrated into [Automotive Grade Linux](https://www.automotivelinux.org/) (AGL),
a collaborative open source project in which
automakers, suppliers and technology companies work together to advance the
development and adoption of a fully open software stack for the connected car.

**2018** NYU Tandon School of Engineering becomes an associate member of the
[Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) and a Bronze member of AGL
on the strength of the Foundationâ€™s adoption of Uptane and TUF projects.

**2018** The Uptane Alliance, a nonprofit entity organized under the umbrella of
IEEE's [International Standards and Technology Organization](https://ieee-isto.org/) is formed.
As an ISTO supported organization, the Alliance will oversee the setting of standards
for the implementation/deployment of Uptane, as well as the advancement and
improvement of the technology itself.
